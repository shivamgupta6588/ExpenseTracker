# Transaction Management System

## Overview

This project is a Transaction Management System built with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to manage their financial transactions by adding, updating, and categorizing them.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, sign in, and securely authenticate using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Transaction Management**: Users can add new transactions, view transaction lists, update existing transactions, and filter transactions based on various criteria.
- **Category Management**: Transactions can be categorized into different categories for better organization.
- **Export Transactions**: Users can export their transactions as CSV files for external analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Transactions are visualized using charts to provide insights into income, expenses, and category-wise spending.
